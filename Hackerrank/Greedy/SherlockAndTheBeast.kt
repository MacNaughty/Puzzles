/*
A Decent Number has the following properties:
    1. Its digits can only be 3's and/or 5's.
    2. The number of 3's it contains is divisible by 5.
    3. The number of 5's it contains is divisible by 3.
    4. It is the largest such number for its length.
    
Given an integer n, where 1 <= n <= 100000, find the decent number for n
